Reflection

Through this project, we learned how to use API keys to access information from a database. Although we had some prior 
knowledge of Python, we were able to further our understanding by working on our program. We mainly worked with 
dictionaries and became familiar with the functions that allowed us to add and access items. The most enjoyable part of the 
project was messing around with the user input part. It was fun to put in different songs and see the results the generator 
would produce. Initially, we wanted to do the project in Java but we weren't able to find a library that was easy to use in 
the language. There were also some libraries that didn't function like they were supposed to because they were outdated and 
Genius recently changed the way it allows developers to access information from their database. It was frustrating to spend so 
much time trying to debug code that didn't even end up working because it wasn't updated. We spent some time going back and 
forth between our options, but eventually, we settled on a Python library, and it ended up working well for our project. The 
most helpful tool for our learning was probably the internet. There were very clear explanations on Python's basic data 
structures and helpful functions on websites like https://www.w3schools.com/ and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/. We were able 
to quickly find answers to most of the questions we had about Python, enabling us to make quick progress while coding.
